            In 2013, Mitsuha Miyamizu is a high school girl living in the rural
            town of Itomori, Japan. Bored of the town, she wishes to be a Tokyo
            boy in her next life. One day, she inexplicably begins to switch
            bodies intermittently with Taki Tachibana, a high school boy in
            Tokyo. Thus, when they wake up as each other on some mornings, they
            must live through the other's respective activities and social
            interactions for the day. They learn they can communicate with each
            other by leaving messages on paper, phones, and sometimes on each
            other's skin. Mitsuha (in Taki's body) sets Taki up on a date with
            coworker Miki Okudera, while Taki (in Mitsuha's body) causes Mitsuha
            to become popular at school. One day, Taki (in Mitsuha's body)
            accompanies Mitsuha's grandmother Hitoha and younger sister Yotsuha
            to leave the ritual alcohol kuchikamizake, made by the sisters, as
            an offering at the Shinto shrine located on a mountaintop outside
            the town. It is believed to represent the body of the village
            guardian god ruling over human connections and time. Taki reads a
            note from Mitsuha about the comet Tiamat, expected to pass nearest
            to Earth on the day of the autumn festival. The next day, Taki wakes
            up in his body and goes on a date with Miki, who tells him she
            enjoyed the date but also that she can tell he is preoccupied with
            thoughts of someone else. Taki attempts to call Mitsuha on the phone
            but cannot reach her as the body-switching ends.
